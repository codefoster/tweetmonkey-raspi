##Tweet Monkey
Tweet Monkey is a hilariously simple maker project. The goal is to get you started in a very fun and rewarding area.

To get started, go to [tweetmonkey.io](http://tweetmonkey.io).

This repository is specific to the Raspberry Pi 2 running Raspian.

I hope you'll notice that it would be a snap to change the monkey out for your own novelty item of choice, so with these basic skills you can build all sorts of awesome projects. Go for it!
